# IsThisAHangout
Ever thought about a single platform for all anime, manga and gaming enthusiasts to come together and discover new anime, manga and video games? Of course there are some online websites that offer similar services, only that they are quite ill - maintained and full of spam and ads. 
My app, IsThisAHangout, is a mobile application, which is a better alternative. You can come together with fellow enthusiasts, explore new anime, manga and video games, share blog posts, videos, chat and much more , ALL in one single app.
